1. Alvin's Memoization Recipe

	1.1 Make it work:

		1.1.1 Visulaize the problem as tree.

		1.1.2 Implement the tree using recursion.

		1.1.3 test it.

	1.2 Make it efficient:

		1.2.1 add memo variable or object.(maybe by passing as argument or global object.).

		1.2.2 add a base case to return memo values.(base condition of recursion.).
		
		1.2.3 store return values into the memo.
